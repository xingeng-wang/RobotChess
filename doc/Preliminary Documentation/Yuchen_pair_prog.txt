Pair prog:

Session 1: Ryan Park

During our session, Ryan and I developing the Server class together.  
During my turn as a pilot, I wrote the helper functions that connect
the coordinate transformation system of the game board which implement
by Jordan and Ryan.  And Ryan help me with building the communaication
using akka between Server and game board because Ryan is more familar with
it than me.  And during my turn as a co-pilot, Ryan manipulation the 
message passing between the Server and Player(client), and the player 
queueing system which is used for manage the turn.  Having the pair
programming is good for avoiding mistakes and allow each person focus more
on the task he actually good at.  Also, having someone asking question 
about the code at the same time is good for unscrambling the thoughts for
programmer.  

Session 2:  Xingeng Wang

During our session, Xingeng and I developing the moving function in Server.
During my turn as a pilot, I wrote the helper function that manage the turn,
which means the getNextRobot and getNextPlayer function.  And Xingeng help me 
to connect the manage turn function with the part he wrote, which is the 
move function, better.  During my turn as a co-pilot, I help Xingeng with 
the move function.  Since the move function need to manage the turn when previous
player end his turn, getNextRobot and getNextPlayer is useful for move function.
With pair programming, it will save time to read the other's code in order to 
use it.  Not only avoiding mistakes, two programmers split a important function
can also save time than one person write it all.
