Session 1: willie

During our pair programming session, willie and I co-implemented the PlayerInfo class which is not one of our major  class 
so its size is not very big and hard to implement. Because of this reason i take role of pilot on implementing all of 
the function in this class but the test. when one of us is coding, another one is always very helpful to check if we make some
mistake and if we follow the coding style or not. when I am in my co-pilot role, i help willie to check if there is some test case 
which might happen but we didn't test yet so we can same time in future.


Session 2: Yuchen Lin

Yuchen and I was doing pair programming on some of the helper function in the server class, these function are not easy and normally
not a small size. It is very easy to make some mistake by these reasons. with another pair of eyeson the scree, the mistake we make 
will be much easy to be found out, before we went to coding, we always discuss the way we can implement the function and to see if 
there is a better ways and we feel this is helpful for us. we switch our role every half hour to 45 minites so our brain and hand can 
take a break .
