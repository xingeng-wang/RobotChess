Pair programming sessions : Willie van Heerde


Session 1: Xin

	For my first session I paired with Xin and we chose to work on the player info class.
	Xin started first with programming and as he was coding I peer reviewed his code as he
	was working on it while making some tests for the static main class. Because I had 
	implemented the robot class by myself I knew what procedures should be done when
	creating the 3 robots in the player info constructor. I used this knowledge when we
	switched roles in our pair programming session to ensure the test cases we were both
	working on now would work. After I had finished coding we had to make minor changes to
	the code from the few bugs we found when using our test cases. Because of the simple
	nature of the class we were both able to quickly and efficiently implement the class
	that was integral to the server class that Xin was working on as well.


Session 2: Jordan	
	
	For my second session I paired with Jordan and we choose to work on the reference sheet
	class because it is a simple to implement class that is essential to the project to
	function. Because this class was relatively simple it was easy to make a error because
	it was so simple there was little planning before implementing the code. For example I
	was fixated on using a linked list to store the value for each of the statistics but,
	Jordan pointed out that this was unnecessary because the values never get removed, 
	altered, or reordered so a simple array would work (0 for scout, 1 for sniper, 2  for 
	tank). When we finished our session we both had made test cases that ensured when we
	did our final walkthrough we would know if there were any bugs in out code.Because of 
	this we were able to quickly finish the class and implement tests in the static main 
	that verified that each thing works as it should. By working together in our pair
	programming session we were able to quickly finish and test the work we sought out 
	to do.
