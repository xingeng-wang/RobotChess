Session 1: Jordan Nelson

During our pair programming session, Jordan and I co-implemented the game board's coordinate transformation system.
While one of us was coding, the other would draw pictures of the hexes and their corresponding mappings. 
The co-pilot would also be responsible for developing the arithmetic algorithms on paper while the pilot was responsible
for translating this algorithm to code. Having this separation of concern allowed both pilot and co-pilot to focus
on their respective tasks.


Session 2: Yuchen Lin

During our session, Yuchen and I continued developing the Server class. During my turn as the pilot, I implemented
message passing between the server/player as well the games player queueing system. Since I was not concerned with
handling the player actions, I was able to quickly outline the servers main structuring. While I was the co-pilot,
Yuchen wrote the various helper functions that would utilize the coordinate transformation systems (developed by Jordan and I)
to handle the manipulations of the game board.
