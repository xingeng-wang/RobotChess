Class Interpreter
A representation of a Forth language interpreter. 
Each AI player thread should have 3 instances of this interpreter (one for
each robot type). Upon creation, the given script is parsed into a list of Forth words. 
When the server indicates that it is this AI players turn, the play() method is called.

The interpreter class contains the following 4 attributes:
	String scriptPath; // absolute path of script file location
	List words; // a parsed list of words for a given script
	Map variables; // a map to store Forth declared variables
	Stack stack; // a stack used to interpret Forth scripting language

/*
 * Constructor for Interpreter class.
 * Creates an input stream from the file at scriptPath, then invokes parseFile()
 * Pre: None
 * Post: new interpreter instanciated
 */
Public Interpreter(String scriptPath);

/*
 * Run by the AI player when signaled by the server.
 * Iterates through the words list and calls eval() for each Forth word.
 * Pre: Forth script has been parsed (at class construction time)
 * Post: Control is returned to the server thread
 */
Public void play();

/*
 * Helper function used by the constructor.
 * Reads in characters from the file and creates Forth words and adds them to the words list.
 * Pre: Valid Forth script file is passed in.
 * Post: words is poplulated with Forth words 
 */
Private void parseFile(FileStream file);

/*
 * Helper function used by play() method.
 * Evaluates the given word, pushing/popping them onto/off the stack.
 * Certain operation words, such as scan!, it should send a request off 
 * to the server for the necessary info and block while waiting.
 * Pre: Word is a valid Forth word
 * Post: none
 */
Private void eval(String Word);
