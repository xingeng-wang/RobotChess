Attendance : Everyone except Jordan present (made clear 2 weeks ago he had would not be in town for the weekend.)

Start time: 4:00PM

The group accomplished in pooling all our scenarios, diagrams, and gui mockups together. We were tired after getting everything to 
a satisfactory level that we left 4 small fields for Jordan to extend on his trip back. Jordan will also be viewing the document and
sharing any concerns/changes. After this we will submit the assignment.
