User Interface

Given the current time constraints, we will be implementing a very basic 2D interface. 
If time permits, we would like to extend our GUI to allow for more advanced visuals (see Additional Features for more details).


Stalemate Conditions

Due to the nature of the game and the limitations of the AI, it is possible for a game to remain in a state of prepetual stalemate. 
Ex. Players do nothing every turn, players move back and forth between the same hexes, etc.

In order to remedy this situation, a game shall be declared a stalemate and end if one (1) or more of the following conditions are met:
	(a) No players expend movement points for X	consecutive turns (X to be determined)
	(b) No players issue attack commands for X consecutive turns (X to be determined)
	(c) No damage has been dealt to any robot for X consecutive turns (X to be determined)
