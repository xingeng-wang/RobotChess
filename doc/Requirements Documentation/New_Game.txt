This is the action that sets up the game to be played. The primary user will from the main menu choose the create game button. From here the user will
input the number of human players & the number of AI players. It is possible for the user to create a game where there are: Only AI players,
only human player, and a mix of both. No matter how the user chooses to organize the game the user will then press the confirm button which transitions
into the board view perspective for the first player (this ends the start game scenario).
