    The fire command is one of the commands that the user can do when it is their turn. The user is able to attack a tile provided that it is within their
current tank's range and they have already not attacked in the current turn. The user is able to attack any tile if the conditions are met, this means the user
can choose to attack a tile that is: empty, has a tank occupying it (even your own tanks), the tile that the current tank is occuping. Note that during the user's
turn they can attack once at any point during their turn so they can shoot before moving and vice versa.
