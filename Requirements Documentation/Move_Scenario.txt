A move action happens during a human or AI player chooses a robot to move, as long as that robot 
is able to move, that player is still arive (and thus the robot is also still alive) and there is
another player on the board still alive. After the move action is over, the robot is on the hex
the player wished, and the movement points the robot has left that turn are decremented by the 
amount the player moved. The actual move happens in the following way: 
The player uses the mouse to click the 'move' button on the GUI, and the hex's within the movement 
range around the robot are 'highlighted' by lighting up/displaying some kind of colour/animation.
The player then uses the mouse to click on which hex they wish the robot to move to. When this 
happens, the previous hex's that were highlighted return to normal, and the robot moves to that
hex (possibly by playing some animation). The old hex the robot was on is unhighlighted from its
'current robot hex' animation, and the new hex the robot is on is highlighted instead. The fog of 
war is adjusted, so out-of-range hex's are covered and in-range hex's are revealed. The stat showing
the movement range the robot has left is then decremented by the amount the robot has moved. After this,
the game then waits for the next player input. The only error conditions that can arise in this action
is if the player tries to click on an out-of-range hex, in which case nothing happens.
